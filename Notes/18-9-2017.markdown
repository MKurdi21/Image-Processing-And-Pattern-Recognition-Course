# Introduction 

Digital Image processing refers to processing digital images by 
mean of a digital computer. It is a branch of machine learning and AI that goes into
the process of extracting useful data from images or modifying images in a certain way. 

## The Work flow of Image Processing

- Image Acquisition and Preprocessing : The first step of the process, this is about selecting our images.

- Image Segmentation and Analysis : Extracting certain regions of an image and analyzing the objects in them, the 
*Semantics* of the image, and its description.

- Feature Extraction : Extracting some characteristics from an image for a certain purpose.

- Applications of Image Processing : These could be things such as Image Classification,
Face Detection, Face Recognition, Optical Character Recognition, License Plate Recognition, etc.

- Post processing : modifying images in a certain way such as contrast adjustment .

## What Do we need to Know to Get Started with Image Processing?

- Maths! It's very important to know linear algebra, since all images are
technically matrices, any process we do on an image is a linear algebra
operation.

- MATLAB(or another similar software). It's what we are going to be mostly use for experimenting.
