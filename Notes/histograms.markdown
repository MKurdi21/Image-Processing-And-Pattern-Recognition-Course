# Histograms 

- A histogram plots how many times(the frequency) of each intensity in
an image occurs.

- Helps avoid taking overexposed pictures.

- Easier to detect types of processing previously applied to an image

- Widely used in image processing.

- a common practice is to normalize the histogram function by the number of 
pixels in an image.
  - This helps us to remove bias.
  - The sum of all components of a normal histogram is equal to 1.
